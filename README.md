This library converts coordinates in latitude/longitude to UTM and from UTM to latitude/longitude.

Here's a sample run showing all off essentially all of the functionality.

It is based heavily on information from Steve Dutch's [UTM info website](http://www.uwgb.edu/dutchs/FieldMethods/UTMSystem.htm) and [UTM formula website](http://www.uwgb.edu/dutchs/UsefulData/UTMFormulas.htm).

It does not make any attempt to correct for the polar regions, so the results for those areas may be incorrect.  To learn why UTM breaks at the polar regions, [see here](http://www.uwgb.edu/dutchs/FieldMethods/UTMSystem.htm).

The calculations seem to be fairly accurate.  Converting from lat/lon-> utm -> lat/lon returns the same latitude and longitude within 6 or 7 decimal places, which is probably more accurate than coordinates coming from a regular GPS unit.  The results also match up with several online converters, such as [this very good one](http://www.rcn.montana.edu/Resources/Converter.aspx) on the University of Montana's website.
